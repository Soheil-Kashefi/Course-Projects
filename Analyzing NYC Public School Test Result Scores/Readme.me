# üìä SQL: Analyzing NYC Public School Test Result Scores

## üìã Overview

This project analyzes SAT performance across public schools in New York City using SQL queries. The analysis focuses on standardized test scores (reading, math, and writing) to identify patterns in school performance and discover top-performing institutions across different boroughs.

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process. This analysis helps various stakeholders including policy makers, education professionals, researchers, and parents make informed decisions about NYC's public education system.

## üéØ Objectives

- Explore SAT performance data across NYC public schools
- Identify schools with exceptional performance in different subjects
- Analyze performance variations across NYC boroughs
- Find top-performing schools by subject area and overall performance

## üìä Dataset

The analysis uses a single database table named `schools` containing:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `school_name` | varchar | Name of school |
| `borough` | varchar | Borough location of the school |
| `building_code` | varchar | Building identification code |
| `average_math` | int | Average SAT math score |
| `average_reading` | int | Average SAT reading score |
| `average_writing` | int | Average SAT writing score |
| `percent_tested` | numeric | Percentage of students completing SATs |
